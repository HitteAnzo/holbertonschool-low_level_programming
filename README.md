## Description

This project includes various tasks and exercises designed to teach low-level programming concepts in C, including data structures, memory management, file I/O, and more.

## Structure

The repository is organized into several directories, each focusing on different C programming concepts:

- **argc_argv/**: Argument handling in C programs
- **bit_manipulation/**: Bitwise operations
- **doubly_linked_lists/**: Implementation of doubly linked lists
- **file_io/**: File input/output operations
- **function_pointers/**: Using function pointers
- **functions_nested_loops/**: Functions and nested loops
- **hello_world/**: Basic C programs
- **malloc_free/**: Dynamic memory allocation
- **more_functions_nested_loops/**: More on functions and nested loops
- **more_malloc_free/**: Advanced memory allocation
- **pointers_arrays_strings/**: Pointers, arrays, and strings
- **recursion/**: Recursive functions
- **singly_linked_lists/**: Implementation of singly linked lists
- **structures_typedef/**: Structures and typedef
- **variables_if_else_while/**: Variables and control structures
- **variadic_functions/**: Variadic functions

## Usage

To use the programs and scripts in this repository, clone the repository and navigate to the relevant directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HitteAnzo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
cd holbertonschool-low_level_programming
```

Compile and run the C programs using a C compiler, such as gcc:

```bash
gcc -o output_file path/to/source_file.c
./output_file
```
